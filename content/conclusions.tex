\section{Major Contributions}
\label{sec:major-contributions}

In this thesis we presented an overall workflow to reason on role-based models. Proper formalization
of contexts is crucial for role-based systems, but logical formalisms able to express these, easily
tend to become undecidable .  We introduced a novel family of description logics which is capable of
expressing contextual knowledge, even in the presence of rigid roles, i.e.\ relational knowledge
which is context-independent.  For these contextual description logics we did a thorough analysis on
the complexity of the consistency problem where we investigated different settings depending on
whether rigid role names or rigid concept names are admitted. It could be shown that for the least
expressive setting where no rigid names are allowed at all, the complexity class of the consistency
problem does not increase compared to the non-contextual version of that DL, namely the consistency
problem is \ExpTime-complete up to \SHOQSHOQ and \NExpTime-complete for \SHOIQSHOIQ. On the other
hand, allowing rigid roles, which often causes undecidability in other approaches, only increases
the complexity by one exponential.

We also looked into a broad variety of description logics
ranging from the lightweight DL \EL up to the very expressive DL \SHOIQ and, hence, obtained a
nearly complete map of complexity results.

But the purpose of this thesis was not only to theoretically investigate a logical formalism capable
of reasoning on role-based models, but also to provide an expert modelling a complex application
domain support for doing so.

Even though formal semantics are absolutely necessary in order to enable reasoning on role-based
models, they are quite elaborate and hard to comprehend.

Finally, we implemented a reasoner for our contextual description logics based on highly 

While analyzing the complexities, we could show that deciding consistency could be split up into two
subtasks. We further refined these sub-problem 




\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future-work}

As mentioned earlier we focused in this thesis on the overall workflow, but we also see several
linking points for future research. When investigating \LMLO we mainly focused on the consistency
problem as most important for our goal. But besides that, interesting work in the direction of query
answering awaits to be investigated. Recently, there has been done a lot of work in the area of
temporal query answering, and as our approach shares a similar setting, we are sure, that there is
plenty motivation, applications and methods available to analyze contextual query answering. There
is also current work on role-based databases, and due to the close connection of query answering and
database theory, there also might arise interesting collaborations.

Going back to the consistency problem, we still think one can narrow the gap to undecidability. We
added contextual concepts to \LMLO which results in undecidability in the presence of rigid
roles. Quite certain, there are other, probably more restrictive, means to further extend the
expressive power of the logic and stay decidable.

Another extension to \LMLO could be in the area of temporal logics. The combinations of DLs with
temporal logics, point-based or interval, are well understood. So why not also combine temporal
logics with contextual DLs. On a more abstract level, it might be even possible to analyze common
properties of these combinations and deduce an abstract combination of DLs with itself or with other
logics. Then temporal DLs or contextual DLs could be one instance of that abstract combination.

Besides the theoretical aspects of \LMLO, we see role-based modelling as one potential
use case. Starting from the mapping we presented, one can adapt these ideas for other applications
and maybe detect some missing expressiveness of \LMLO.

The last starting point for future work would be the reasoner. While we used a black box approach,
combined or integrated  (tableaux) algorithms for deciding consistency are easily conceivable. A different
optimization would be an even more target oriented reasoner, which behaves especially well for
contextual ontologies produced from CROM models. Since, for example, validation of role groups is
rather of combinatorial nature which is quite hard for DL reasoners, it might be useful to use SAT
solvers internally to improve overall performance.
