\label{cha:jconht}




\blindtext

In this chapter we only consider \LMLO ontologies instead of \LMLO-BKBs.


We want to check consistency of \O.

From Lemma \ref{lem:admissible-and-outerConsistent} we know that it is necessary that \Ob is
consistent. Assuming \Ob is consistent, we still have to find an
$\Xmc\subseteq\powerset{\ran{\bsf}}$ such that \Xmc is admissible and \Ob is outer consistent
w.r.t.~\Xmc. 

No rigid names, so we can look into each world separately.
