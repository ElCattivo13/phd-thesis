\label{cha:mapping}

In the last chapter we introduced a family of description logics which are capable of expressing
contextual knowledge. 

 

How to use cDLs in practice?

Semantics, even when durchdacht und präzise, hard to comprehend.

Motivation for looking into cDLs were role-based systems.

automatic mapping from such a system desirable.

Formal representation of role-based system necessary.

Chosen the family of CROMs introduced by Kühn.

Also say what limitations occur, what cannot be represented in cDL

\section{A Formal Role-Based Modeling Language}
\label{sec:sigma-crom}


In this section we will present a syntactical variant of the \emph{Compartment Role Object Model}
defined in \textbf{[Ku-SLE15]}\todo{citation}. This variant is simply introduced for easier
explanation of the mapping to description logics.

\subsection{Type and Instance Level}
\label{sec:type-instance-level}

We omit the graphical notation and 

\todo[inline]{some more information}



\begin{definition}[$\Sigma$-Compartment Role Object Model]\label{def:scrom}
  Let \NT, \RT, \CT and \RST be finite and mutually disjoint sets of Natural Types, Role
  Types, Compartment Types, and Relationship Types, respectively.  The tuple
  $\Sigma = (\NT, \RT, \CT,\RST)$ is a \todo{or better alphabet?}\emph{vocabulary}.
  A \emph{$\Sigma$-Compartment Role Object Model ($\Sigma$-CROM)} \Mmc is a tuple \MM where
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\fills\subseteq(\NT\cup\CT)\times\RT$ is a right-total binary relation,
  \item $\parts:\CT\to\Pmf$ is a bijection where \Pmf is an arbitrary but fixed partition of
    \RT, and
  \item $\rel:\RST\to\Smc$ is a bijection where $\Smc\subseteq\bigcup_{P\in\Pmf}P\times P$ is an
    irreflexive binary relation. \qedhere
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

In the rest of this thesis, we use the following phrases:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{$T$ fills \rt} if $(T,\rt)\in\fills$,
\item \emph{\rt participates in \ct} if $\rt\in\parts(\ct)$,
\item \emph{\rst participates in \ct} if $\rel(\rst) = (\rt[1],\rt[2])$ with $\{\rt[1], \rt[2]\}\subseteq\parts(\ct)$,
\item \emph{\rt[1] and \rt[2] are related via \rst} if $(\rt[1],\rt[2]) = \rel(\rst)$, and
\item \emph{\rt[1] is the domain of \rst ($\dom(\rst)$) and \rt[2] is the range of \rst
    ($\ran(\rst)$)} if $(\rt[1],\rt[2])\in\rel(\rst)$.
\end{itemize}



Since \fills is a right-total relation, for each role type there exists a natural type or
compartment type that fills it.  As each element of \Pmf is a non-empty subset of \RT, the image
of \parts does not contain the empty set.  Since \Pmf is a partition each role type participates in
only one compartment type.  Due to the irreflexivity of \Smc there exists no $\rst \in \RST$ and
$\rt \in \RT$ such that $\rel(\rst) = (\rt,\rt)$. Furthermore, since \Smc is a subset of
$\bigcup_{P\in\Pmf}P\times P$, the pair of role types in the image of \rel always participate in the
same compartment type. Hence, equations (1) to (5) of \textbf{[Ku-SLE15]} are satisfied.

Note here, that reasoning about role-based models does not include checking \emph{well-formed\-ness}
as defined in Definition 1 of \textbf{[Ku-SLE15]}, since that is a pure syntactical check. Therefore the
above definition already ensures that a \SCROM is well-formed. 

Next, we introduce instances based on role-based models.


\begin{definition}[$\Sigma$-Compartment Role Object Instance, Compliance]\label{def:scroi}
  Let $\Sigma = (\NT, \RT,$ \todo{kann man so was machen???}$\CT,\RST)$ be a vocabulary.  Then, a
  \emph{$\Sigma$-Compartment Role Object Instance ($\Sigma$-CROI) \I} is a tuple
  $\I=(\Gamma^{\I},\type,\plays,\links)$, where
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\Gamma^{\I}$ is a non-empty domain,
  \item $\type:\Gamma^{\I}\to\NT\cup\RT\cup\CT$ is a total function,
  \item $\plays \subseteq \Osf\times\Csf\times\Rsf$ is a ternary relation, and
  \item $\links: (\RST\times\Csf) \to \powerset{\Rsf\times\Rsf}$ is a total function.
  \end{itemize}
  with 
  \begin{align*}
    \Nsf & \coloneqq \{d \in \Gamma \mid \type(d) \in \NT\}, \\
    \Rsf & \coloneqq \{d \in \Gamma \mid \type(d) \in \RT\}, \\
    \Csf & \coloneqq \{d \in \Gamma \mid \type(d) \in \CT\}\text{ and} \\
    \Osf & \coloneqq \Nsf \cup \Csf
  \end{align*}
  being the sets of \emph{naturals}, \emph{roles}, \emph{compartments} and
  \emph{objects}, respectively. Furthermore, the set of all objects playing a role in $c$ is denoted by
  $\Osf[\I,c]$, i.e.\ $\Osf[\I,c] \coloneqq \{o \in \Osf \mid (o,c,\cdot) \in \plays\}$. For
  $T \in \NT\cup\RT\cup\CT$, $T^{\I}$ is the set of all elements of that type, i.e.\
  $T^{\I} \coloneqq \{d \in \Gamma \mid \type(d) = T\}$.

  A $\Sigma$-CROI \I is \emph{compliant} with a \SCROM{} \Mmc, denoted by $\I\models\Mmc$, if it has the following
  properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The \plays-relation respects \fills, i.e.~for each tuple $(o,c,r)\in\plays$ the type of $o$
    fills the type of $r$:
    \begin{align*}
      \{(o,r)\mid(o,\cdot,r)\in\plays\}\ \subseteq\ \{(o,r)\mid\text{there exists
        $(T,\rt)\in\fills$ s.t. $o\in T^{\I}$, $r\in \rt^{\I}$}\}.
    \end{align*}
  \item The \plays-relation respects \parts, i.e.~for each tuple $(o,c,r)\in\plays$ the type of $r$
    participates in the type of $c$:
    \begin{align*}
      & \{(c,r)\mid(\cdot,c,r)\in\plays\}\\
      & \qquad \subseteq\ \{(c,r)\mid \text{there exists $\ct \in \CT$, $\rt \in \RT$ s.t. $c \in
        \ct^{\I}$, $r \in \rt^{\I}$, $\rt \in \parts(\ct)$}\}.
    \end{align*}
  \item Each object can only play one role of each role type in each compartment:
    \begin{align*}
      \{(o,c,r),(o,c,r')\}\subseteq\plays \textImplies \type(r)\neq\type(r').
    \end{align*}
  \item Each role is played by exactly one object in exactly one compartment:
    \begin{align*}
      |\{(o,c)\mid(o,c,r)\in\plays\}| = 1 \quad\text{for all $r \in \Rsf$}.
    \end{align*}
  \item Roles occurring in the image of \links are played in the associated compartment, i.e.\ for
    each $(r_{1},r_{2})\in\links(\rst,c)$ there exists objects that play $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ in $c$:
    \begin{align*}
      \{r_{1} \mid (r_{1},\cdot) \in \links(\cdot,c)\} \cup \{r_{2} \mid (\cdot,r_{2}) \in \links(\cdot,c)\} \ \subseteq\ \{r\mid(\cdot,c,r)\in\plays\}.
    \end{align*}
  \item The \links-function respects \rel, i.e.\ for each $(r_{1}, r_{2}) \in \links(\rst, \cdot)$ the
    types of $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are related via \rst:
    \begin{align*}
      (r_{1},r_{2}) \in \links(\rst, \cdot) \textImplies \rel(\rst)=(\type(r_{1}),\type(r_{2})).
    \end{align*}
  \end{enumerate}

  A \SCROM{} \Mmc is \emph{compliable} if there exists any \SCROI{} \I such that $\I\models\Mmc$. 
\end{definition}

We say that $r$ is an $\rt$-role or $c$ is a $\ct$-compartment if, respectively,
$\type(r) = \rt \in \RT$ or $\type(c) = \ct \in \CT$.  Furthermore, \emph{$o$ plays $r$ in $c$} and
$o$ is the \emph{player} of $r$ if $(o,c,r) \in \plays$, and \emph{$r_{1}$ is linked to $r_{2}$ via
  $\rst$ in $c$} if $(r_{1}, r_{2}) \in \links(\rst, c)$.

Since the \plays-relation respects the \fills- and the \plays-relation, if $o$ plays an \rt-role in
a \ct-compartment, then the type of $o$ must fill \rt and \rt must participate in \ct. If $o$ plays
$r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ in $c$ then $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ must have different types, because each object
can only play one role of each type in the same compartment.

\todo[inline]{}\noindent
%
Thus, equations (6) to (11) of \textbf{[Ku-SLE15]} are satisfied.


Before we investigate how the information about a \SCROM can be encoded in a description logic
ontology, we have to discuss the main reasoning tasks for role-based models. The arguably most
apparent question is, given a \SCROM{} \Mmc and a \SCROI{} \I, whether \I is compliant with
\Mmc. But as this task rather belongs to the area of model checking, we will not focus in this
thesis on that problem.
%
Instead, given a \SCROM{} \Mmc, it is much more interesting whether there exists any \SCROI that is
compliant with \Mmc.  Additionally we often want to know for a specific \SCROM{} \Mmc whether there
exists a compliant \SCROI that fulfills certain assertions, e.g.\ that a role of a certain type is
played.  To express these assertional knowledge, we introduce a so-called \SCROA, a set of
assertions which should be fulfilled by an \SCROI.

\begin{definition}[$\Sigma$-Compartment Role Object Assertions] \label{def:scroa} Let
  $\Sigma = (\NT, \RT, \CT, \RST)$ be a vocabulary and let \IND be a non-empty set of individual
  names disjoint from $\Sigma$.  A $\Sigma$-Compartment Role Object assertion is of the form
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $T(a)$ with $T \in \NT \cup \CT \cup \RT$,
  \item $\playass(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3})$ with $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3} \in \IND$, or
  \item $\linkass(\rst, a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3})$ with $\rst \in \RST$ and  $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3} \in \IND$ .
  \end{itemize}

  A \emph{set of $\Sigma$-Compartment Role Object assertions (\SCROA)} \A is a set of such
  assertions.
  %
  We extend the \SCROI{} \I to additionally map individual names to domain elements, e.g.\ $a$ is
  mapped to a domain element $a^{\I} \in \Gamma$. A \SCROI{} \I is \emph{compliant with an assertion
    $\alpha$}, denoted by $\I\models\alpha$ if
  \begin{itemize}
  \item for $\alpha$ of the form $T(a)$: $a^{\I} \in T^{\I}$,
  \item for $\alpha$ of the form $\playass(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3})$:
    $(a_{1}^{\I}, a_{2}^{\I}, a_{3}^{\I}) \in \plays$, and
  \item for $\alpha$ of the form $\linkass(\rst, a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3})$:
    $(\rst, a_{1}^{\I}, a_{2}^{\I}, a_{3}^{\I}) \in \links$.
  \end{itemize}

  A \SCROI{} \I is \emph{compliant with \A}, denoted by $\I\models\A$ if it is compliant with all
  assertions in \A.
\end{definition}

Note here, that without any assertions or further restrictions as introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:constraint-level} there always exists a trivial CROI with the singleton set $\Gamma =
\{o\}$, the type of $o$ being some natural type, and \plays and \links being empty sets that is
compliant with \Mmc.


\subsection{Constraint Level}
\label{sec:constraint-level}

When modelling a domain of interest, not only the type of an object defines whether that object is
allowed to play a certain role. These additional constraints can be divided into four groups.

The first category of constraints are \emph{role constraints}, e.g. roles that mutually exclude each
other or playing one role implies playing another role. More general these constraints are
formalized with  so-called \emph{role groups}. These consist of a set of role
types (or again role groups) and a lower and an upper bound. An object fulfills a role group if it
plays at least the lower and at most the upper bound of roles from the set of role types.


 

\begin{definition}[Syntax of Role Groups]\label{def:syntax-role-groups}
  Let \RT be a set of role types. The set of \emph{role groups over \RT} is the smallest such that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item if $\rt \in \RT$, then \rt is an (\emph{atomic}) role group, and
  \item if $A_{1}$, \dots, $A_{n}$ are role groups, $k,l \in \nat$, then $(\{A_{1}, \dots, A_{n}\},
    k,l)$ is a (\emph{complex}) role group.
  \end{itemize}
  \emph{Atoms} of a role group $A$ are defined as:
  \begin{align*}
    \atom(A) & \coloneqq
               \begin{cases}
                 \{\rt\} & \text{if $A = \rt \in \RT$}\\
                 \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \atom(A_{i}) & \text{if $A = (\{A_{1}, \dots, A_{n}\},k,l)$}.
               \end{cases}
  \end{align*}

  \vspace{-1.81\baselineskip}
\end{definition}

The semantics of a role group are based on a \SCROI and are locally evaluated for each domain
element and each compartment.  The interpretation function $\cdot^{\I,c,o}$ calculates recursively
whether an object fulfills the role group.

\begin{definition}[Semantics of Role Groups]\label{def:semantics-role-groups}
  Given a \SCROI{} \I, the semantics of a role group $A$ is defined for an object $o \in \Osf$ in
  $c \in \Csf$ as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    A^{\I,c,o} & \coloneqq 
                 \begin{cases}
                   1 & \text{if $A = \rt$ and $o$ plays an \rt-role in $c$,} \\
                   1 & \text{if $A = (\{B_{1},\dots,B_{n}\},k,l)$ and $k \leq \sum_{i=1}^{k}
                     B_{i}^{\I,c,o} \leq l$, and}\\
                   0 & \text{otherwise.}
                 \end{cases}
  \end{align*}

  If $A^{\I,c,o} = 1$, we say that $o$ fulfills $A$ in $c$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Constraint Set, Validity]
  Let $\Sigma = (\NT, \RT, \CT, \RST)$ be a vocabulary, let \RG be the set of role groups over \RT
  and let $\Card \coloneqq \nat \times \natinf$ be the set of cardinalities.  Then, a
  \emph{$\Sigma$-Compartment Role Object Constraint Set (\SCROC) \Cmc} is a tuple $\CC$ where
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\occur : \CT \to \powerset{\Card \times \RG}$,
  \item $\card : \RST \to \Card \times \Card$, and

  the following properties:
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item All occurrence constraints are respected, i.e.\ if $(k,l,A) \in \occur(\ct)$, then in every
    \ct-compartment there must exist at least $k$ and at most $l$ objects that fulfill role group
    $A$:\todo{im mapping überprüfen: comptype wo exakt 3 objekte rollenimplikation erfüllen}

      A^{\I,c,o} \leq l \right\}
    \end{align*}

  \item All role groups must be satisfied, i.e.\ if an object $o$ plays an \rt-role and \rt is an
    atom of role group A, then $o$ must fulfill $A$:
    \begin{align*}
      (o,c,r) \in \plays \text{, } r \in \rt^{\I} \text{ and } \rt \in \atom(A) \textImplies
      A^{\I,c,o} = 1\text{, for all $o \in \Osf$, $A \in \RG$}
    \end{align*}

  \item All cardinality constraints are respected, i.e.\ every role that is played in a compartment
    $c$ and whose type is either the domain or the range of a relationship type \rst with
    $\card(\rst) = (i..j, k..l)$ must have at least $k$ and at most $l$ \rst-successors in $c$ or at
    least $i$ and at most $j$ \rst-predecessors in $c$, respectively:

        } \card(\rst)=(i..j,\cdot)\\
      & \qquad \textImplies i \leq | \Pred(\rst,r,c) | \leq j
    \end{align*}

  \item All intra-relationship type constraints are respected, i.e.\ every function $\fsf \in
    \intra(\rst)$, evaluated over the players of the roles related via \rst, must return \true:
    \begin{align*}
      & \fsf \in \intra(\rst) \textImplies \fsf(\links^{*}(\rst,c)) = \true, \\
      & \qquad\text{for all $c$ in $\ct^{\I}$ s.t.\ \rst participates in \ct}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{enumerate}

  The auxiliary functions used above are defined as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \Succ(\rst,r,c) & \coloneqq \{r' \in \Rsf \mid (r,r') \in \links(\rst,c)\}, \\
    \Pred(\rst,r,c) & \coloneqq \{r' \in \Rsf \mid (r',r) \in \links(\rst,c)\}\text{, and} \\

relation that cannot be expressed in classical description logics. More precisely, role-playing can

concept names. Natural types and Role types as object concept names.

Consider the meta and object signatures $\Msig=(\MC,\MR,\MI)$ and $\Osig=(\OC,\OR,\OI)$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $\CT \subseteq \MC$ since every compartment type is a meta concept,
\item $\NT \subseteq \OCR$ since every natural type is an rigid object concept,
\item $\RT \subseteq \OCF$
\item $\RST \subseteq \OR \setminus \ORR$ since every relationship type is an flexible object role.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, we introduce the rigid object concept $\Ant \in \OCR$ for all naturals, the flexible
object concept $\Art$ for all \rosiroles and the flexible object role
$\plays \in \OR \setminus \ORR$ to express the \plays-relation.
%
At first, we express general knowledge about $\Sigma$ that is independent of the specific
\SCROM.

  \intertext{Analogous to \fills restricting the domain and range of \plays, the \rel-function

\end{align}

Note here, that due to equations~\eqref{eq:compartments-coverage},
\eqref{eq:roles-coverage},~\eqref{eq:roles-disjoint} and~\eqref{eq:roles-in-compartment} and the
fact that \parts' codomain is a partition of \RT, in any context that is not in \ct there are no
\rosiroles of a type the participates in \ct , e.g. the following axiom is entailed for all
$\ct\in\CT$:
\begin{align*}
  \lnot\ct & \sqsubseteq \oax{\bigsqcup_{\rt\in\parts(\ct)}\rt\sqsubseteq\bot}
\end{align*}

  \ct(a)\\
  \intertext{For $T(a)\in\A$ with $T\in\NT\cup\RT$ the individual $a$ is a natural or \rosirole
  that belongs to the concept $T$ in some context.}

  \intertext{A \links assertion $\linkass(\rst,a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}) \in \A$ states that $a_{2}$ is
