\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

Nowadays, we are surrounded by software systems literally everywhere. With regard to current
developments there will be even more in the future. Not only the amount increases, but also the
requirements and expectations users impose on current software steadily rise. Modern software
systems should cope with complex scenarios. This includes the ability of context-awareness and
self-adaptability. For example, a robot in a smart factory should recognize when a human coworker
approaches and switches to a different, human-friendly working mode accordingly. Similarly, software
in autonomous cars or an the area of smart homes needs to adapt 


Besides that there is still plenty of software running in legacy code. Especially in areas
where the correctness of the software is utterly important, e.g., in banking applications, a large
amount of old 

These software system are very hard to maintain


To sum up, current software systems long-lasting, high complexity, easy to maintain.

\section{Description Logics}
\label{sec:intro-description-logics}

Besides the means of role-based models to aid modelling complex and context-dependent
domains, the process is still tedius and hard. 

Many constraints, unintended implications or even unconsistencies. imparative for domain analysts to reason


Description Logics (DLs) are a well-known formalism for knowledge representation

The basic building blocks in description logics are so-called \emph{concepts}.

\section{Contextualized Description Logics}
\label{sec:intro-contextualized-description-logics}

\todo[inline]{ConDL with top down view, first describe contexts, then what's going on inside. from
  within we can't refer to other contexts, trade-off between rigid roles and contextual concepts}

\section{Ontology generator}
\label{sec:zweite-section}

Besides capability of contextualized description logics, it is rather hard for domain analysts who
in general are not experts in the area of DLs to capture the precise semantics and model the
contextual ontology correctly. 

evolved and elaborate semantics of condl

we present mapping which captures most parts of CROM

forfeit expressiveness, conDL can express more than CROM
