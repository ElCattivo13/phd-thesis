% Symbols permitted in metadata
% =============================
% 
% Within the metadata, all printable ASCII characters except
% '\', '{', '}', and '%' represent themselves. Also, all printable
% Unicode characters from the basic multilingual plane (i.e., up to
% code point U+FFFF) can be used directly with the UTF-8 encoding. 
% Consecutive whitespace characters are combined into a single
% space. Whitespace after a macro such as \copyright, \backslash, or
% \sep is ignored. Blank lines are not permitted. Moreover, the
% following markup can be used:
%
%  '\ '         - a literal space  (for example after a macro)                  
%   \%          - a literal '%'                                                 
%   \{          - a literal '{'                                                 
%   \}          - a literal '}'                                                 
%   \backslash  - a literal '\'                                                 
%   \copyright  - the (c) copyright symbol                                      
%
% The macro \sep is only permitted within \Author, \Keywords, and
% \Org.  It is used to separate multiple authors, keywords, etc.

%                      'False' if it isn't. This is automatically set
%                      to 'True' if either \Copyright or \CopyrightURL
%                      is specified, but can be overridden. For
%                      example, if the copyright statement is "Public

%
% Publication information:
%
% \PublicationType   - The type of publication. If defined, must be
%                      one of book, catalog, feed, journal, magazine,

%                      automatically set to "journal" if \Journaltitle
%                      is specified, but can be overridden.
% \Journaltitle      - The title of the journal in which the document
%                      was published.

% \Lastpage          - Last page number of the published version of
%                      the document.
% \Doi               - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the
%                      document, without the leading "doi:".
% \CoverDisplayDate  - Date on the cover of the journal issue, as a
%                      human-readable text string.

\Subject      {In a modern world software systems are literally everywhere. These should cope with very
               complex scenarios including the ability of context-awareness and self-adaptability. The concept
	       of roles provide the means to model such complex, context-dependent systems. In role-based
	       systems, the relational and context-dependent properties of objects are transferred into the
	       roles that the object plays in a certain context. However, even if the domain can be expressed
	       in a well-structured and modular way, role-based models can still be hard to comprehend due to
	       the sophisticated semantics of roles, contexts and different constraints. Hence, unintended
	       implications or inconsistencies may be overlooked. A feasible logical formalism is required
	       here. In this setting Description Logics (DLs) fit very well as a starting point for further
	       considerations since as a decidable fragment of first-order logic they have both an underlying
	       formal semantics and decidable reasoning problems. DLs are a well-understood family of
	       knowledge representation formalisms which allow to represent application domains in a
	       well-structured way by DL-concepts, i.e. unary predicates, and DL-roles, i.e. binary
	       predicates. However, classical DLs lack expressive power to formalise contextual knowledge
	       which is crucial for formalising role-based systems.
	       %
	       We investigate a novel family of contextualised description logics that is capable of
	       expressing contextual knowledge and preserves decidability even in the presence of rigid
	       DL-roles, i.e. relational structures that are context-independent. For these contextualised
	       description logics we thoroughly analyse the complexity of the consistency problem.
	       Furthermore, we present a mapping algorithm that allows for an automated translation from a
	       formal role-based model, namely a Compartment Role Object Model (CROM), into a contextualised
	       DL ontology. We prove the semantical correctness and provide ideas how features extending CROM
	       can be expressed in our contextualised DLs. As final step for a completely automated analysis
	       of role-based models, we investigate a practical reasoning algorithm and implement the first
	       reasoner that can process contextual ontologies.This is where you put the abstract.}
